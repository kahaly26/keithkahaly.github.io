<h2><center>School Life</h2></center>
<p> Freshmen year, I lived in gannet hall wuth a few seprate roommates. Before long I made good friends with the many of other students in my hall and eventully joining the rugby team.
Rugby has been a great investment of my time and has really opened me to a new gorup of people based around the love for a unorthidox sport.</p>

<p>I decided to attend the University of Maine out for the reason on being a larger state school tucked away in the deep woods of Maine. As a student of the Maine Buisness School, I have greatly enjoyed all of my college level courses while the difficulty of classes increases as i progress in my degree.<p>
