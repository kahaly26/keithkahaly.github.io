<h1><b><center>Interests</h1></b></center>
<p><center>As a kid, I always enjoyed being outdoors and near the ocean. Many summers spent in Cape Cod at Magannsett harbor fishing with my Dad and Brother.</p></center>

<p><center>Since i have come to college in Maine, it has exposed me to hobbies such as snowboarding and hiking with friends. Countless weekends spend on the mountain with many more to come.</p></center>

<p><center>Living just outside the greatsest sport city in the world, taught me to love the local pro teams through all of their success. Between gillette stadium, TD Garden and Fenway, 
much time of mine is spent cheering on championship runs every year.
